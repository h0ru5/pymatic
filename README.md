XMPP Client to expose a HomeMatic CCU

This XMPP Client connects to a HomeMatic CCU via the XML API plugin.
It exposes the functions (and later on the data points) via XMPP so they can be accessed using off-the shelf clients and specialized apps.

## Requirements

Python 2.7+ and [SleekXMPP](https://github.com/fritzy/SleekXMPP)

## License

GPLv2, if you need a different one please get in touch with me

## Roadmap / Contributing

Next steps:

* add data points to disco
* add text interface
* custom IQs and js lib
* tidy code, unit tests (cowboy coding so far)

Pull requests, donations and high-fives are welcome.
